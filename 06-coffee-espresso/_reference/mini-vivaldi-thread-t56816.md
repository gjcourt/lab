# Mini Vivaldi Pressure-Profiling Build Thread (t56816) — Digest & NAS Pointer

> Original synthesis of the **seminal** home-barista thread
> ["La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi and pressure profiling"](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/la-spaziale-mini-vivaldi-and-pressure-profiling-t56816.html)
> (t56816, 46 posts, Feb–Apr 2019). This is where `blondica73` did the **first documented US ito +
> `leva!` install on a Mini Vivaldi II** and `sandc` (Dietmar, the firmware author) answered. It
> predates — and is the origin of — the later Q&A thread
> ([t61709](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/ito-leva-controller-q-experience-t61709.html)).

## The nine things this thread pins down for 06-001

1. **Sensor tap = a T-fitting into the brew line**, not a factory "pre-tapped port". blondica added
   a tee on the brass brew block with the spare branch capped for a future gauge (post #3). The
   adapter needed filing to fit (#1).
2. **OPV just above max brew pressure** (e.g. slightly over 9 bar): keeps the safety function
   without biasing the flow meter or fighting the profile (#10).
3. **Stock flow meter is a GICAR** — pinout **red = +VCC, white = signal/output, black = GND**,
   behind 3× 3 mm Allen screws (#21/#22). It's an **open-collector output already pulled to 5 V
   internally** (measured: +14.3 V rail, signal 0↔5 V); the 14.8 V meter rail must **never** touch
   ito (5 V + 0.5 V input max) (#13, #26).
4. **Share the stock meter; don't stack a second in series.** A second (kit) meter before the pump
   added a restricting nozzle that cut free flow ~10 % (575→640 mL/min once removed) (#31). blondica
   bridged the stock meter to ito via a **CD4011 NAND gate + PC817 optocoupler** for isolation
   (#25–#27).
5. **The pressure pre-test won't run out of the box:** the stock board drops the SNS signal on
   "inactivity". Fix with a temporary **SNS↔L jumper**, or just **press the shot button first, then
   start the test** (#12–#14). Test data survives firmware upgrades.
6. **The Mini Vivaldi pump is "lazy"** — ~half the bar/s rise rate of a Rancilio Silvia at full
   power; leva! can't exceed the machine's full-power ramp, so characterise that ceiling first
   (#17). blondica later swapped in a **ULKA EX5** pump (#21).
7. **Tuning:** keep **Kc<SP and Kc>SP close** (his 25 vs 90 gave wild swings; ~20 was clean,
   #17–#19). leva! uses **two parameter sets split at 2.5 bar by setpoint** (not actual pressure);
   below 2.5 bar is tuned to avoid overshoot — raise Kc if you undershoot there (#40). If the bias
   plot rides ~5° above the pump-power plot, reduce **Flow Corr by ~5°** (#22).
8. **The flood→profile flow drop is expected, not a bug:** the pump runs full power until ~0.7 bar
   fills the air pockets, then the loop takes over (P, I ≈ 0 at zero error). Start the profile
   higher (e.g. 1.2 bar) to avoid the audible stutter (#45, #46).
9. **Display mount without cutting the face:** sandc's reversible idea is to 3D-print a **La
   Spaziale Dream S1 bezel** (which has a display by design) and swap the Mini Vivaldi's passive LED
   PCB for a custom-shaped one (#30). blondica instead Dremel-cut the opening (#28, #31).
