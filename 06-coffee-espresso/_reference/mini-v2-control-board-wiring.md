# La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi II — Control-Board Wiring Reference

Shared electrical reference for the **La Spaziale S1 Mini Vivaldi II** (Clive's **LUCCA A53 Mini**)
control board. Every project that interposes on this machine's mains wiring taps the same board, so
the terminal map, the "no switched rail" gotcha, and the flow-meter pinout live here once:

- [06-001 — ito + `leva!` pressure/flow profiling](../06-001-lucca-a53-mini-leva-firmware-integration.md)
- [06-011 — direct plumb-in (reservoir float-fill)](../06-011-mini-v2-direct-plumb-in.md)
- [06-012 — `leva!` PID temperature takeover](../06-012-leva-pid-temperature-takeover.md)

Everything below is from the **official Owner's Manual** (§6.1 Electrical Connection Diagram, §6.2
Control-Board Connection Diagram, §6.5 legend), cross-checked against `blondica73`'s install
(home-barista t56816 / t61709) and **confirmed by meter on a US 120 V unit (2026-07)**.

## The M5 output terminal strip

The control board's main terminal strip (**M5**), **top → bottom** as printed in the manual, with
the wire-ferrule marks seen on a real board:

| Pos     | Manual label | Board mark    | Function                           | Type          |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1 (top) | EV. AL       | `A`           | Autofill (boiler-refill) solenoid  | switched load |
| 2       | EV. H        | `2`           | Hot-water solenoid                 | switched load |
| 3       | **PUMP**     | _(unlabeled)_ | **Vibratory pump**                 | switched load |
| 4       | EV. GR       | `1`           | Group / brew solenoid              | switched load |
| 5       | **PHASE**    | `F`           | **Line / 120 V hot — ALWAYS LIVE** | mains in      |
| 6       | NEUTRAL      | _(white)_     | Neutral                            | mains in      |
| 7       | NEUTRAL      | _(white)_     | Neutral                            | mains in      |

Earth is a **separate ground stud** (yellow ⏚), not on M5. The strip reconciles with blondica's
bottom-up count: "1st/2nd from bottom = N, 3rd = PHASE, 4th = group solenoid."

## ⚠️ There is NO switched mains rail

The power pad is a **soft-touch logic input** — it only toggles **ON ⇄ Standby**, it is not a mains
switch. The manual's diagram shows **PHASE fused straight off the plug** with no master relay, so
**`F`/PHASE + `N` are live the entire time the machine is plugged in**, in both ON and Standby
(metered: `F` → GND = 120 VAC even in standby). The only things that get switched are the **load
outputs** (PUMP, EV.GR, EV.H, EV.AL) and the two heater triacs — each hot only while the controller
actually drives that load.

**Consequence:** you cannot get a "hot only when the machine is on" L+N pair from F/N. To gate
something on machine activity, either **tap a load output** (the PUMP tab is the useful one — see
below), or power the whole machine from a **switched outlet / smart plug** (La Spaziale's own on/off
method — the "S1 Power Retain Timer" accessory is exactly that).

## Identifying the loads by meter

The pump is the only load that fires in **two** different operations, so cross it. Meter each
suspect tab → a NEUTRAL tab:

| Operation                                                | Loads energized        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Brew a shot                                              | **PUMP** + EV.GR (`1`) |
| Steam-boiler autofill (draw steam/hot water so it drops) | **PUMP** + EV.AL (`A`) |
| Hot-water tap                                            | EV.H (`2`)             |

- Hot in **both** brew and autofill → **PUMP** (the unlabeled 3rd-from-top tab).
- Hot in brew only → EV.GR (`1`); hot in autofill only → EV.AL (`A`); hot on hot-water only → EV.H
  (`2`).
- `F`/PHASE + the two `N` tabs stay live throughout — not discriminators.

> **Phantom voltage:** an unconnected tab next to live wiring reads tens of volts (~40 VAC observed)
> on a high-impedance meter — capacitive coupling, not a real source. It collapses to ~0 under any
> load or in the meter's **LoZ** mode. Ignore it.

## The stock GICAR flow meter

3-pin turbine/Hall meter with an **open-collector pulse output**:

| Pin (molded) | Function                                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`          | VCC (~14.3 V) — **Vivaldi-side ONLY; NEVER to a 5 V logic input** (5 V + 0.5 V max) |
| `−`          | GND                                                                                 |
| `o`          | Output — **5 V open-collector** pulse (pulled to 5 V inside the Vivaldi)            |

Coarse (~2 pulses/ml) — fine for **display + volume dosing**; leva! 3.0 flow-_tracking_ prefers the
Digmesa nano (48 pulses/ml), adaptable per sandc (t61709 #179): 10 N on C8, 4K7 on R6, set 48000
impulses/L.

## How each project taps this board

- **[06-001] ito + leva! profiling** — cut the **PUMP** wire at the pump → route the control-board
  side to ito **`SNS`** (zero-cross + "pump on"), and drive the pump from ito **`Relay 1`**. Share
  the GICAR **`o` + `−`** into ito's flow input via a **CD4011B buffer on ito's 5 V rail** (keep
  GICAR `+` on the Vivaldi only). Opto optional (isolation).
- **[06-011] plumb-in** — derive the fill-solenoid's 12 VDC PSU from the **PUMP** output (L = PUMP
  tab, N = a white tab). The solenoid then opens **only when the pump draws from the tank** →
  fail-safe (closed when idle/off), and with **no smart-plug dependency**. Same tab does double duty
  with 06-001's `SNS` sense (a few-watt PSU is negligible on that relay, behind the 5 A fuse). ⚠️
  **Refill-rate caveat:** pump-gating refills only during pump windows with no catch-up between
  draws, so if the float valve can't match the pump's peak draw (worst case = boiler autofill, ≈600
  mL/min) the tank ratchets down → size the fill ≥ pump draw, or add a ~30–60 s solenoid off-delay
  (see 06-011).
- **[06-012] PID takeover** — the boiler/group heating elements switch via the **triac board** (an
  external 20 A SSR driven from ito's `SSR` connector), separate from M5.
