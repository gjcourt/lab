# Lucca A53 Mini Pressure & Flow Profiling via ito + `leva!`

## Description

Add **lever-style pressure and flow profiling** to the **La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi II** (Clive's
**LUCCA A53 Mini**) by installing the **ito microcontroller module** (softwareandcircuits.com, EU)
and running the **`leva!`** firmware. leva! closes a feedback loop on a pressure sensor and drives
the existing **vibratory pump** via phase-angle control — nearly stepless — to follow a programmed
pressure/flow curve (pre-infusion → ramp → decline), exactly like a lever machine.

**This is no longer speculative for this machine.** Multiple Mini Vivaldi II owners in the
[home-barista ito/leva! thread](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/ito-leva-controller-q-experience-t61709.html)
have this running. A full local index of that thread (365 posts, Nov 2019 → Apr 2026) lives at
`/Volumes/family/projects/electronics/espresso/home-barista-thread-index/INDEX.md`, and the leva!
firmware + hardware-install PDFs are at
`/Volumes/family/projects/electronics/espresso/leva! (for ito)/`.

> Owner `blondica73` (thread post #2): _"I used the ITO board to upgrade my La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi
> II … I have mine set up to read the pressure, flow, and temperature (group head block)."_ Cost was
> ~$200 for the kit, shipped to family in the EU and hand-carried to the US (it isn't sold here).

before/after of the fluid + electrical paths across this project and
[06-011](06-011-mini-v2-direct-plumb-in.md) (one shared teardown).

## Scope

This project is **pressure/flow profiling only**. leva! can _also_ take over PID temperature
control, but on the A53 that **conflicts with the stock control board** — owners run profiling and
leave temperature to the factory electronics. That separate, optional, harder workstream is split
out into **[06-012 leva! PID Temperature Takeover](06-012-leva-pid-temperature-takeover.md)**.

## How leva! profiles a vibratory pump

Not obvious that you _can_ pressure-profile a vibe pump — you can, and have been able to since the
`caffè!`/`leva!` lineage added it (~2016; same idea the Decent uses). Per the firmware author
(`sandc`/Dietmar) in-thread:

> "Regular control loop with feedback: pressure sensor measures pressure, controller adjusts pump
> power, nearly stepless via phase-angle control (the pump sounds more or less normal)."

Pump power is expressed as a **phase angle**: 0° = full power, ~105–120° = pump stops (vibe pumps
quit well below 180°). leva! computes that angle from a proportional + integral response to the
pressure error; you tune it like a PID loop. Factory defaults won't produce good shots "except by
luck" — tuning is the real, ongoing work of this project (see Tuning below).

## Before / after: the control loop

Stock, the pump is a brute — full power until the shot ends. With ito + leva!, brew pressure is
measured continuously and the pump's power is dialed via **phase angle** to track a programmed curve
— a real feedback loop, like a lever machine's declining pressure. (Complements the shared
[modifications-at-a-glance](_reference/mini-v2-modifications.md) wiring view; this one tells the
control-loop story.)

## The A53-specific fluid-system wrinkle: the over-pressure bypass

The Mini Vivaldi II has a **brew over-pressure bypass valve** that returns water to the pump inlet.
Two consequences for profiling, both from the thread:

1. **Set it above your max brew pressure.** If it opens at/near brew pressure it will fight the
   profile and bias the flow meter. Aim for it to crack only **just above 9 bar** (or whatever your
   profile ceiling is). leva! has a `PRESS OPV` setting to account for it.
2. **Flow-meter placement matters because of it.** Install the flow meter on the **tank→pump line
   (before the pump)**, which is what owners did. A meter downstream of the bypass would read high.

Note the manual's general profiling rule — _no pressure-affecting component between the sensor and
the portafilter_ (no gicleur jet, no spring-loaded shower-screen valve, no S11/B valve). Owners
report tapping a **T-fitting into the brew line** and profiling cleanly, so the A53 grouphead has
**not** required surgery in practice — but **verify your own grouphead** when you're in there
(Pre-flight below). The bypass valve, not a grouphead valve, is the thing to get right.

## Bill of materials

The ito kit bundles most of this. Buy the **full kit with pressure sensor + flow meter**; you can
ignore the PID/SSR parts for now (those belong to 06-012).

## As-received kit configuration

The kit shipped **directly to a US address** (Jan 2025, from Dietmar Eilert /
softwareandcircuits.com), so the "hand-carry from an EU address" note above is optional — the vendor
will ship to the US.

Configuration from the "keep this document" card (these are the values you set in leva! at setup):

| Pressure sensor   | 200 / 215 / 300 PSI option — **confirm the checked rating** (9 bar ≈ 130 psi, within range of all three)                           |

**Fully loaded — reconciles the BOM above:**

- Includes the **SSR kit + TSic sensor** (the PID hardware). This project stays profiling-only, but
  the temperature-takeover hardware for [06-012](06-012-leva-pid-temperature-takeover.md) is already
  on hand — no re-order.
- Also includes a **fluid-installation kit** (OKS grease, PTFE, 3× fittings for G1/8" systems), the
  **TouchCell bracket**, **BLE**, and the **USB-serial (FTDI) adapter** — so BOM row 7 (flow-meter
  fittings) and the programming adapter are largely covered by the kit. **Verify the G1/8" fittings
  match the Mini V2's brew/tank lines** before assuming row 7 is closed.

## Pre-flight (verify before committing)

1. **Confirm it's the Mini (vibe pump).** leva! drives **vibratory** pumps only. The full-size A53
   uses a **rotary** pump and is **not** compatible (its motor's inrush can destroy the SSR). The
   Mini Vivaldi II / A53 Mini is the vibe-pump model → OK.
2. **Inspect the grouphead.** Open it and confirm there's no spring-loaded valve / gicleur / S11/B
   restrictor between the sensor tap point and the portafilter. Owners report a clean path; verify
   yours.
3. **Check pump + 3-way valve seal condition.** Worn non-return / 3-way seals that are fine at
   normal pressure **leak under profiling**. An old machine may want a pump rebuild first.
4. **Confirm the bypass valve cracking pressure** and plan to set it >9 bar.

## Build sequence (start here — all parts + machine on hand)

Grounded in the ito **Hardware Reference Manual** (on the kit DVD, archived at
`.../espresso/ito-dvd/Manual/Manual.pdf`). The pressure-loop tuning is the _separate_ leva! firmware
manual — see **Tuning** below and `_reference/leva/`.

1. **Pre-flight** (section above): vibe-pump confirmed, grouphead path clear (no gicleur/S11 between
   the sensor tap and the portafilter), pump/3-way seals sound, bypass valve noted.
2. **Mount & power ito.** Solder the on-board HLK-PM01 PSU (or wire external 5 V / ≥600 mA). Fit the
   4 adhesive feet + acrylic insulation shield; mount in a **non-metal or grounded enclosure — not
   metal screws** (insulation distance), away from boiler heat. Wire **N/L to the machine's
   switched-mains rail**; use a surge-protected outlet. Keep mains leads separated from low-voltage
   leads (EMC).
3. **Wire the pump for phase-angle control.** Route the vibratory pump through an ito on-board
   **relay (clamp 1 or 2)**; feed the **pump-switch L phase into `SNS`** for zero-cross detection +
   "pump on" (phase-angle needs SNS to see the L phase). → **Do steps 2–3 in the same machine-open
   session as [06-011](06-011-mini-v2-direct-plumb-in.md)'s switched-mains solenoid interlock** —
   identical wiring area, one teardown.
4. **Install the sensors.** Pressure sensor → **ADC** header (tee into the brew line; confirm the La
   Spaziale pre-tapped port or file the adapter; mount **vibration-free**, cool-ish, gauge branch
   optional). Flow meter → **IMPULSE** header on the **tank→pump line, before the pump** (R6 pull-up
   already fitted for the 932-xxxx). _(TSic → AUX and OLED → SPI/ENC are optional / for
   [06-012](06-012-leva-pid-temperature-takeover.md).)_
5. **WLAN.** ito boots in **AP mode** (SSID `ito Module`; **set a custom password first** at
   `http://192.168.4.1`). Switch it to **STA mode** to join your 2.4 GHz router; set a **static DHCP
   lease** so the IP stays stable/bookmarkable.
6. **Flash leva!** (macOS) — in **ZOC**, connect to ito's IP on **port 2323** (Telnet / Raw socket,
   **Xmodem-CRC**) → press RETURN (drops into the bootloader) → type **`f`** → **Upload** the leva!
   `.hex` (firmware `1 - ito with rotary encoder`, from the `leva! (for ito)` archives) → exit with
   `q`. ⚠️ ito must be in **AP or STA mode, _not_ STA+AP**; close Status Monitor first; back up
   settings via port 23 beforehand if wanted.
7. **Configure + fluid prep.** Install Status Monitor + its XML (plots pressure/flow/temp over
   WiFi). Set the pressure-sensor scaling, flow-meter type, and **`PRESS OPV`**; set the machine's
   over-pressure **bypass valve to crack just above 9 bar**. Then → **Tuning**.

## Tuning (the real, ongoing work)

Run the firmware-manual tutorials, then iterate with the Status Monitor plots (turn on the **pump
power / phase-angle** trace — temperature plots don't help when debugging pressure):

- **Pressure pre-test** (Menu, p.49) to seed pump characterization — needs a blind filter.
- **`K` (proportional)** — start near the values owners cite (~3.5 gave clean graphs for one). Halve
  it if you see oscillation/roughness; raise it if the pressure jump is sluggish.
- **`I`** — integral response.
- **`PHASE OFF`** — the pump-stop phase angle; tune if a soaking pre-infusion (e.g. 20 s @ 1.1 bar)
  drifts above setpoint.
- **`PRESS MAX` / `PRESS OPV`** — ceiling + bypass accounting.
- **`Flow Corr`** — biases the feed-forward; nudge so the bias line tracks the pump-power line in
  the first seconds of the shot.

A good starting recipe from the thread: **`Gen Lever` preset profile + ~10 s pre-infusion @ 1.5
bar** produced well-regarded shots on a Mini Vivaldi II. The firmware author actively tunes owners'
curves in-thread if you post phase plots.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] ito installed; leva! `1 - ito with rotary encoder` flashed; Status Monitor plotting live
      pressure + flow + temp.
- [ ] Pressure sensor reads a credible brew-pressure curve; flow meter reads plausible mL/s.
- [ ] Over-pressure bypass set >9 bar; `PRESS OPV` configured; no flow-meter bias artifacts.
- [ ] A `Gen Lever` (or custom) profile tracks setpoint within a fraction of a bar at the plateau
      (not 7.9 bar when 9 is programmed).
- [ ] Pre-infusion (e.g. 10 s @ 1.5 bar) holds without overshoot; clean declining-pressure shot.
- [ ] No leaks at the sensor tee or flow meter after a session of shots.
- [ ] Display/encoder mounted without cutting irreplaceable parts.
- [ ] Stock temperature control still works (PID takeover deferred to 06-012).

## Progress

- [x] Researched leva! firmware + hardware-install manuals (local PDFs)
- [x] Indexed the full home-barista ito/leva! thread; confirmed Mini Vivaldi II owners profiling
      successfully (index at `.../home-barista-thread-index/INDEX.md`)
- [x] Scoped to profiling-only; split PID takeover into 06-012
- [ ] Pre-flight: confirm vibe pump, inspect grouphead path, check seal condition, bypass pressure
- [x] Source ito kit from the EU (complete kit in hand: module + pressure sensor + flow meter +
      encoder)
- [ ] Source not-in-kit extras (flow-meter fittings, SNS wiring, PETG, tablet) — measure line
      sizes + confirm the pre-tapped sensor port first
- [ ] Install pressure sensor (T-tap) + flow meter (pre-pump)
- [ ] Wire pump to ito SNS (combine the machine-open work with 06-011's switched-mains interlock
      tap); design + print PETG display/encoder housing
- [ ] Flash leva!; install Status Monitor XML
- [ ] Set bypass + `PRESS OPV`; run pressure pre-test
- [ ] Tune K/I, PHASE OFF, Flow Corr against Status Monitor plots
- [ ] Dial in a lever profile; document as-built (sensor location, profile, tuned params)
